## POC

This build version demonstrates the core functions that exist in Super Oiram.

### General Structure

Oiram (The player sprite) contains three separate states. These states are class based Finite State machines that
determine how/where to move the player sprite. A player controller class that uses Unity's new Input System is used
to switch states given the inputs and current state of the player. A utility class exists which is used to provide 
logic functions that don't necessarily belong to any kind of sprite character (Rect collision checking, camera bounds, etc).

A Level class exists that is responsible for dynamically loading in levels using a bitmap level editor. Giving a Level object a reference
to an array of textures loads a level at the start based on the pixels of the texture. The utility function uses the bounds of the level texture to
determine where to stop the camera and make sure the player can't go off the side of the screen.


### Structure and Potential problems of the Finite State Machine

While the Finite State machine allows for a higher level of Seperation of Concern it heavily violates the open closed principle.
Every time I add a new state I have to consider how/when that state can be swapped to and if I can ever coexist with a current state.
This is partly why the player character uses three separate states.

1) **Ground State**

These types of states are simply used to change the y direction in which the player moves. It does NOT actually move the player.

2) **Move State**

These states are responsible for much more. These states change the x direction, check for collisions, and they are the ones moving the player.

3) **Game Stat**

These states are simply used to see if the player has won/lost or is currently playing. They flag an event system whenever the player wins or loses
and also disable the player controller when necessary.

Looking back I structured my state system poorly. State is an abstract class which is meant to be inherited by any state and the player character contains three States.
What I should have done is further subclass State with another level of abstract classes (GroundState : State, MoveState : State, etc). I've already made several logic errors
where I accidently assign a MoveState into the groundState which causes for some hard debugging. With the player's state machine complete I may consider revisiting this and
fixing the debt I've created.






## VS

This build refactors the Level component into smaller managers (entities & blocks). These managers are more independent and add SoC.

### General Structure

I initially chose Unity because I disliked dealing with monogame's load order. However by implementing managers and having dynamically loaded levels I was forced to deal with
load orders anyways. Level exists in the the scene hierarchy and is instantiates three prefabs it has references to: Util, BlockManager, EntityManager.

Util is just a utility class that contains a few static methods/variables. It uses information from the main camera to set screen bounds, perform the math on collisions, and
has a color dictionary. This violates SoC a fair bit because its kinda just a bunch of crap thrown into the class.

BlockManager reads a level texture and places down the blocks. After that, it generates "Chunks" which are larger rectangles. The chunk algorithm is dynamic and tries its best
to space everything evenly. The final chunk usually ends up being larger but thats okay. Chunks are later given to entities such as goomba's and mario so they end up checking for
collision with far fewer blocks every frame.

EntityManager reads in the same level texture and places down entities. An "Entity" is where I feel I've failed a little. Entity is seemingly too generic. For example, a player is an entity.
and so is a goomba, the flag pole, and any coins present in the stage. The methods they inherit and override feels sloppy and I found myself writing code just to make it all fit together.
This was a good lesson in UML first, code later.


### Issues with the damn finite state machine

I am still wrapping my head around proper implementation of the GoF state pattern. Making anything that uses more abstract versions of a class is really different and I need to read up on
Generics and/or decorator pattern to be able to implement it properly.

The MoveState class is an abomination which forces the player and goombas to check for collisions with things.
Again this is where UML first would be much more beneficial.

I would re write this from scratch if I had time/patience.

### Good stuff

I'm very content with how strong the aglorithm that builds the levels is. As long as the map is more than 30ish blocks wide there are no issues. Below 30 blocks and the camera might do some weird
panning after crossing a threshold, nothing game breaking but a bit odd to see.

If this was a 5/6 week project I'd consider making the worst Mario Maker 3 and go all out on the level editor since I think making mario levels and then playing them is fun.





### FB

This build I spent a good deal of time trying to break away from some dependencies with unity. I did what I could to break off some logic into POCOs and have Unity versions encapsulate them. 
While this helped, the root of the most critical aspects of game logic (mario and goomba movement) rely on Unity and I just don't have enough time to rip out the state machine and rework it to be
more engine independent.

I also broke my entities down further by making "Entities" and "Movers". Entities are static (non moving) and Movers and... moving. This lets me remove unnecessary properties such as speed, direction, etc
from coins and the flag.

Lastly I put a bit of polish in the game by adding Audio and Animation.

Animation uses unity to build the actual clips but utilizes my finite state machine behavior to actually determine what animation it plays.

Audio on the other hand is completely reliant on Unity. I don't have enough time to create an audio system thats abstractable outside it. Its pretty hacky because it throws a lot of if catches into my player class.
Combined with the already messy logic intertwined with the state machine things get very ugly.

There is one final bug I can't seem to work out. Goombas are checking for collision with eachother and acting on that collision, but theyre also checking for collision with other blocks. Because they may sometimes
hit both at the same time things can get weird. I've removed their sideways collision to help with this and it mostly works albeit really weird happenings due to floating point percision errors I can't seem
to track down.
